# Göttingen Beamer Template

This is a modified version of the [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) beamer template.

It adds the Göttingen logo, colors and font.

To use this, simply create a document with document class: `\documentclass[lualatex,10pt,aspectratio=169]{beamer}` and `\usepackage{preamble}`.

It requires the font Calibri to be installed on the system and `lualatex` to compile.
